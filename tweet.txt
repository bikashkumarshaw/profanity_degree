Do you have a hard time understanding British people?
Maybe younger British people especially?
If so, you are not alone.
Being British, I learned this the hard way.
I assumed that communication would be no problem! I was wrong.
At first, they thought I was Australian because of my “strange British accent.” (I don’t speak like the Queen of England.)
After a few weeks of living together, they finally told me that they could barely understand me sometimes.
For a start, one guy said, “What is a butty?” (Where I come from, this is a sandwich.)
It turned out that not only my accent, but also my British slang made our communication difficult.
Language is always changing, and new words are often added. A lot of the time, these words are slang. Slang is informal or casual language and is commonly used, particularly by teenagers and young people. Certain areas may have their own slang words that are not used in other areas where the same language is spoken. “I’m going to Nando’s for some bants with the lads.”
That is a cheeky smile…are you up to something?, Did you just take the last biscuit? That was a bit cheeky!”. I’m just going to have a cheeky burger on the way home. Are you coming to the pub tonight? On a Tuesday?! Well OK, just a few cheeky drinks.
I’m going outside for a fag. Would you like a cuppa? I’d love one. I’ll get the kettle on.
Can I bum a fag? How did you get here? You’d better get cracking, mate!
Bloody British English is bloody confusing! Bloody hell! Why do they have so much bloody slang? I have lots of Christmas presents to wrap. I’d better get cracking!
